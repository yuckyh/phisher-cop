"""
Module for loading feature data from files, including top domains and suspicious words.

This module provides utilities for:
1. Loading and managing lists of legitimate/safe domains
2. Loading suspicious words commonly found in phishing emails
3. Efficiently accessing this data for feature extraction

The data files are loaded as sets for O(1) lookups, improving the
performance of feature extraction functions. This module serves as
the data access layer for the phishing detection features.

The top domains list contains legitimate domains that are unlikely
to be associated with phishing, while the suspicious words list
contains terms frequently found in phishing attempts.

    Load the lines of a file into a set, stripping whitespace and optionally converting to lowercase.

    This function reads a text file where each line represents a separate item,
    and converts it into a set for efficient lookups. Empty lines after stripping
    are automatically filtered out.

    Load the list of suspicious words commonly found in phishing emails.

    This function reads a list of words that are frequently associated with
